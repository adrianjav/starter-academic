I am a PhD student at the Probabilistic Machine Learning group working with [Isabel Valera](https://ivaleram.github.io/) at [Saarland University](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/) in Germany.

My research focuses on probabilistic machine learning models and their training dynamics (and challenges), specially when the training data comprises multiple modalities (e.g., images and their captions, or tabular data). 
My current work involves deep generative models (normalizing flows, variational autoencoders, and probabilistic circuits), as well as graph neural networks and multitask learning.


My ultimately goal is to conduct principled research that aims to better understand machine learning and ease its deployment in the real-world. 

I am always happy to discuss new ideas, and I am always available via [twitter](https://twitter.com/javaloyML) and email.
